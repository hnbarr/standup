standup

in this app, I'm aiming to create a crud application using material-ui to be the host of my progress in my development post-ACA.

I will be able to add, remove, update and read: notes and daily tasks. 

Daily Tasks/Todos (todos);
    ~have submission boxes to create titles of new task (New Task)
    ~required fields = todo & date-preset for Date.now
    ~once posted, they get added ot a list, until completed by checking box they will remain on todos.
    ~have a archive page to see all completed tasks for records.
    ~have ability to bumb tasks up or down depending on priority
    ~CRUD

Notes; 
    ~have submission boxes to create notes on troubles, or solutions I stumble upon.
    ~required fields = description, title, focus & date-preset for Date.now
    ~have search input and filter dropdown to filter/search through notes
    ~CRUD


PAGES--
Home Page: (3 sections)
    ~Notes
    ~New Task
    ~Task List
Archived: (2 tabs)
    ~Notes
    ~Tasks

Build Using;
    ~Express (routes & controllers)
    ~Mongo  (model & schema)
    ~Redux (actions, reducers, state, store & containers)
